# EfficientNetB7 - UNet 

The basic building block of the EfficientNet architecture is mobile inverted bottleneck convolution (MBConv) with squeeze and excitation optimization. The family of EfficientNet network has different number of these MBConv blocks. As we go from EfficientNetB0 to EfficientNetB7, depth, width, resolution and model size goes on increasing. In this code, we used EfficientNetB7 as an encoder with UNet decoder.
